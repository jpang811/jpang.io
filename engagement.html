            <p>As with <a href="personalization.html" class="blurb-link">Part 1 of the Data-Driven UX Series on Personalization</a>, personalization is a great conversation starter but it's not enough. I wanted to <span class="keywords">engage users and influence their behavior.</span></p>
            
<<<<<<< HEAD
            <p>One of the problem statemenets I tackled was user acquisition, specifically credit cards for this case study. It always begins from understanding users. Some prefer facts and figures, pros and cons, whereas some are driven by emotions.  Striking that delicate balance between both groups can be challenging.</p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">What's the Deal with Credit Cards?</h3>
            <p>Credit card campaigns can get very old nowadays.  Typically, you receive either a Direct Mail or email with a cookie-cutter message that says "Apply for our credit card and get offer XYZ. Limited Time Offer!". Let's be real, when is it <i>not</i> Limited Time Offer?</p>

            </div>

            <p>The most logical approach is to use machine learning algorithms alike to predict users' likelihood to apply for a credit card. But this doesn't take into account users' emotions and motivations.</p>

            <p>One of the challenges I faced was in the competitive playing field of credit card acquisition. For some users, they are driven by facts and figures, pros and cons, whereas some are driven by emotions.  Striking that delicate balance between both groups can be challenging.</p>

            <p>To understand members from both qualitative and quantitative aspects, I decided to introduce an two-part Engagement piece - an <span class="keywords">Engagement Email</span> which lands on a Buzzfeed-inspired <span class="keywords">Engagement Survey</span>. </p>

            <p>The trick to designing the survey is it isn't just about fun, viral content.  It should serve a purpose.</p>
            <p>In addition to engagement, I did a quick analysis on the offers' competitive advantages which I used them as anchor points to gauge users' interest towards the offer.</p>
            <p>The survey was about users’ travel and lifestyle preferences and outputs with a travel persona. In fact, feel free to give it a shot yourself!</p>

            <p>The trick to designing the survey is it isn't just about creating a trolling or viral meme.  Sure, exposure and impression are great but it's got to have a purpose.</p>

            <p>Of course, <span class="keywords">great things build expectations.</span> So after kicking off with a successful engagement piece, my fellow data scientists got cracking with the survey data and personas so we could follow-up with an acquisition email a week later.</p>

            <p>This is where the magic happens.  Each persona was pre-assigned to a set of personalized content which we can map to corresponding personas. <!--For example, spontaneity, value-seeking and connectivity are important values to Adventure Seekers.--></p>
            <p>For those who had not completed out the survey, we assigned them to a travel persona based on characteristics such as demographics and transactional behavior.</p>

            <p>So what about the targeted users who had not filled out the engagement survey aka <span class="keywords">not engaged</span>, what message to do they get?  We addressed that by clustering those users by transaction behavior and demographics before assigning them to a travel persona.</p>

            <p>As a final wrap-up to this campaign, we launched a reminder email another week later based on users' email behavior.
