            <h3 class="section-heading">There's more to Personalization</h3>
            <p>As with <a href="personalization.html" class="blurb-link">Part 1 of the Data-Driven UX Series on Personalization</a>, personalization is a great conversation starter but it's not enough. I wanted to <span class="keywords">engage users and influence their behavior.</span></p>
            
            <p>One of the problem statemenets I tackled was user acquisition, specifically credit cards for this case study. It always begins from understanding users. Some prefer facts and figures, pros and cons, whereas some are driven by emotions.  Striking that delicate balance between both groups can be challenging.</p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">What's the Deal with Credit Cards?</h3>
            <p>Credit card campaigns can get very old nowadays.  Typically, you receive either a Direct Mail or email with a cookie-cutter message that says "Apply for our credit card and get offer XYZ. Limited Time Offer!". Let's be real, when is it <i>not</i> Limited Time Offer?</p>
        
            
            <div class="pfolio-img">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/ccoffer.png" class="img-responsive adjust2">
            </div>

            <p>The most logical approach is to use machine learning algorithms alike to predict users' likelihood to apply for a credit card. But this doesn't take into account users' emotions and motivations.</p>        
            
            <div class="pfolio-img">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/ccoffer.png" class="img-responsive">
            </div>

            <p>The most logical approach was to use machine learning algorithms alike to predict users' likelihood to apply for a credit card. But even so, it's a very shallow understanding and discounts users' emotions and motivations.</p>

            <p>To understand members from both qualitative and quantitative aspects, I decided to introduce an two-part Engagement piece - an <span class="keywords">Engagement Email</span> which lands on a Buzzfeed-inspired <span class="keywords">Engagement Survey</span>. </p>
           
             
            <div class="pfolio-img" style="max-width: 100%;">
                <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/journey-sketch.jpg" class="img-responsive">
                <p class="remarks-i">User Journey Flow from Engagement email to Engagement survey to the Acquisition email</p>
            </div>
            

            <h3 class="section-heading">Designing the Engagement</h3>
            <p>There are two challenges to this piece. First, how do I get users to click on the Engagement Email?  Second, once they land on the Engagement Survey, how do I get them to complete it?</p>

            <p>The idea sparked when I was on Flipboard and came across this pop-up. </p>
            
            <div class="containter">
                <div class="pfolio-img">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/inspo.jpg" class="img-responsive pfolio-img adjust">
                </div>
            </div>
            
                    
            <p>So this is what I did.</p>
            <div class="containter">
                <div class="pfolio-img">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/email.png" class="img-responsive pfolio-img adjust">
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <p>We A/B tested the subject title and travel quotes and the open rates skyrocketed to over 40% and over 10% for click rates.</p>
            <p>Whether you agree or disagree, brace yourself for a just-for-fun Engagement Survey.</p>
           

            <h3 class="section-heading">So Tell Me, What's Your Travel Persona?</h3>
            <p>The trick to designing the survey is it isn't just about fun, viral content.  It should serve a purpose.</p>
            <p>In addition to engagement, I did a quick analysis on the offers' competitive advantages which I used them as anchor points to gauge users' interest towards the offer.</p>
            <p>The survey was about users’ travel and lifestyle preferences and outputs with a travel persona. In fact, feel free to give it a shot yourself!</p>

            
            <div class="pfolio-img">
                <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/survey.jpg" class="img-responsive adjust2">
            </div>

            <p>Depending on your answers of course, you get one of four personas.</p>
            <div class="pfolio-img">
                <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/persona.jpg" class="img-responsive pfolio-img adjust">
            </div>


            <p>Most of us, it seems, are Adventure Seekers at heart. </p>
            <div class="pfolio-img" style="max-width: 100%;">
                <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/persona-example.jpg" style="float: center" class="img-responsive pfolio-img adjust2">

            </div>

            <p>We hit a good 10% completion rate which were quite impressive given there was no offer attached.</p>

            <p>Of course, <span class="keywords">great things build expectations.</span> So after kicking off with a successful engagement piece, my fellow data scientists got cracking with the survey data and personas so we could follow-up with an acquisition email a week later.</p>
            
            
            <h3 class="section-heading">Acquisition Email</h3>
            <p>This is where the magic happens.  Each persona was pre-assigned to a set of personalized content which we can map to corresponding personas. <!--For example, spontaneity, value-seeking and connectivity are important values to Adventure Seekers.--></p>
            <p>For those who had not completed out the survey, we assigned them to a travel persona based on characteristics such as demographics and transactional behavior.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="hero" style="padding-top: 0px;">        
            <div class="engagement-acqemail"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="container container-condensed">
            <p>The result? A whopping 35%+ open and 4% click rates. </p>
            
            <h3 class="section-heading">Closing the Loop</h3>
            <p>As a final wrap-up to this campaign, we launched a reminder email another week later based on users' email behavior. I personalized the message slightly for three states: Open Only, Click Only and Clicked and Applied. As you may have guessed, the Click Only registered more interest and conversion than Open Only.</p>

            <h3 class="section-heading">What I Learned</h3>
            <p><span class="keywords">Engagement costs nothing.</span></p>
            <p>Turns out that users are willing to engage even with no incentives. Another equally rewarding learning is the ability to influence user behavior - low propensity yet high engaged users. The only expectation, though, is that you <span class="keywords">follow-up.</span></p>

            <div class="containter">
                <div class="pfolio-img">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/learning.jpg" class="img-responsive pfolio-img">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p></p>
            <p>The most rewarding part is the ability to influence members’ behaviour - the ability to convert low propensity yet highly engaged members.</p>
            <p>This is the <span class="keywords">heart of data-driven design</span> and could not have been done without either the engagement nor the quantitative propensity model. In fact, this approach maximized our reach and acquisition numbers.</p>
